A host definition is used to define a physical server, workstation, device, etc. that resides on your network.
The different arguments to a host definition are described below.
</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;host_name&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is a short name used to identify the host.  It is used in host group and service definitions to reference
this particular host. Hosts can have multiple services (which are monitored) associated with them.
When used properly, the $HOSTNAME$ <a href="macros.html">macro</a> will contain this short name.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;host_alias&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is a longer name or description used to identify the host.  It is provided in order to allow you to more
easily identify a particular host.  When used properly, the $HOSTALIAS$ <a href="macros.html">macro</a> will contain this alias/description.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;address&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is the IP address of the host.  You can use a FQDN to identify the host, but if DNS services
are not availble this could cause problems. When used properly, the $HOSTADDRESS$ 
<a href="macros.html">macro</a> will contain this address.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;parent_host&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is the short name of the "parent" host for this particular host.  Parent hosts are typically routers, switches, firewalls, etc.
that lie between the monitoring host and a remote hosts.  The router, switch, etc. which is closest to the remote host is considered
to be that host's "parent".  Read the "Determining Status and Reachability of Network Hosts" document in the <a href="theory.html">theory of operation</a> section for more information. If this host is on the same network segment as the host doing the monitoring (without any intermediate routers, etc.) the host is considered to be on the local network and will not have a parent host.  Leave this value blank if the host does not have a parent host (i.e. it is on the local network).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;host_check_command&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is the <i>short name</i> of the <a href="#command">command</a> that should be used to check if the host
is up or down.  Typically, this command would try and ping the host to see if it is "alive".  The command
must return a status of <a href="statuslevels.html">OK</a> (0) or NetSaint will assume the host is down.
If you leave this argument blank, the host will not be checked - NetSaint will always assume the host is up.
This is useful if you are monitoring printers or other devices that are frequently turned off.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;max_attempts&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is the number of times that NetSaint will retry the host check command if it returns any state other
than an <a href="statuslevels.html">OK</a> state.  Setting this value to 1 will cause NetSaint to generate
an alert without retrying the host check again.  Note: If you do not want to check the status of the host, you 
must still set this to a minimum value of 1.  To bypass the host check, just leave the <b>&lt;host_check_command&gt;</b>
option blank.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;notification_interval&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is the number of "time units" to wait before re-notifying
a contact that this server is <i>still</i> down.  Unless you've changed the 
<b>interval_length</b> value in the <a href="configmain.html">main configuration file</a> from the default
value of 60, this number will mean minutes.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;notification_period&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is the short name of the <a href="#timeperiod">time period</a> during which notifications of events for this host can be sent out to contacts.  If a host goes down, becomes unreachable, or recoveries during a time which is not covered by the time period, no notifications will be sent out.  Read the "Time Periods" document in the <a href="theory.html">theory of operation</a> section for more information.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;notify_recovery&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This value determines whether or not notifications should be sent to any contacts if the host is in a
<a href="statuslevels.html">RECOVERY</a> state.  Set this value to
<b>1</b> if notifications should be sent out about recovery states, <b>0</b> if they <i>shouldn't</i>.
Note: If a <a href="#contact">contact</a> is configured to not receive notifications of host recoveries, they
will not be notified, regardless of this setting.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;notify_down&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This value determines whether or not notifications should be sent to any contacts if the host is in a
<a href="statuslevels.html">DOWN</a> state.  Set this value to
<b>1</b> if notifications should be sent out when the host goes down, <b>0</b> if they <i>shouldn't</i>.
Note: If a <a href="#contact">contact</a> is configured to not receive notifications about hosts that go down, they
will not be notified, regardless of this setting.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;notify_unreachable&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This value determines whether or not notifications should be sent to any contacts if the host is in aa
<a href="statuslevels.html">UNREACHABLE</a> state.  Set this value to
<b>1</b> if notifications should be sent out when the host becomes unreachable, <b>0</b> if they <i>shouldn't</i>.
Note: If a <a href="#contact">contact</a> is configured to not receive notifications about unreachable hosts, they
will not be notified, regardless of this setting.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;event_handler&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is the <i>short name</i> of the <a href="#command">command</a> that should be run whenever a change
in the state of the host is detected (i.e. whenever it goes down or recovers).  Read the documentation on
<a href="eventhandlers.html">event handlers</a> for a more detailed explanation of how to write scripts for
handling events.  If you do not wish to define an event handler for the host, leave this option blank
(as shown in the example above).

Extended host information entries are basically used to make the output from the <a href="cgis.html#status_cgi">status</a>, <a href="cgis.html#statusmap_cgi">statusmap</a>, <a href="cgis.html#statuswrl_cgi">statuswrl</a>, and <a href="cgis.html#extinfo_cgi">extinfo</a> CGIs look pretty.  They have no effect on monitoring and are completely optional.

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;host_name&gt;</strong></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;notes_url&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
This is an optional URL that can be used to provide more information about the host.  If you specify an URL, you will see a link that says "Notes About This Host" in the <a href="cgis.html#extinfo_cgi">extended information</a> CGI (when you are viewing information about the specified host).  Any valid URL can be used.  If you plan on using relative paths, the base path will the the same as what is used to access the CGIs (i.e. <i>/cgi-bin/netsaint/</i>).  This can be very useful if you want to make detailed information on the host, emergency contact methods, etc available to other support staff.
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;icon_image&gt;</strong></td>

The name of a GIF, PNG, or JPG image that should be associated with this host.  This image will be displayed in the <a href="cgis.html#status_cgi">status</a> and <a href="cgis.html#extinfo_cgi">extended information</a> CGIs.  The image will look best if it is 40x40 pixels in size.  Images for hosts are assumed to be in the <b>logos/</b> subdirectory in your HTML images directory (i.e. <i>/usr/local/netsaint/share/images/logos</i>).
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;vrml_image&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
The name of a GIF, PNG, or JPG image that should be associated with this host.  This image will be used as the texture map for the specified host in the <a href="cgis.html#statuswrl_cgi">statuswrl</a> CGI.  Unlike the image you use for the <i>&lt;icon_image&gt;</i> variable, this one should probably <i>not</i> have any transparency.  If it does, the host object will look a bit wierd.  Images for hosts are assumed to be in the <b>logos/</b> subdirectory in your HTML images directory (i.e. <i>/usr/local/netsaint/share/images/logos</i>).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>&lt;gd2_image&gt;</strong></td>
<td>
The name of a GD2 format image that should be associated with this host.  This image will be used in the image created by the <a href="cgis.html#statusmap_cgi">statusmap</a> CGI.  GD2 images can be created from PNG images by using the <b>pngtogd2</b> utility supplied with Thomas Boutell's <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd">gd library</a>.  The GD2 images should be created in <i>uncompressed</i> format in order to minimize CPU load when the statusmap CGI is generating the network map image.  The image will look best if it is 40x40 pixels in size.  You can leave these option blank if you are not using the statusmap CGI.  Images for hosts are assumed to be in the <b>logos/</b> subdirectory in your HTML images directory (i.e. <i>/usr/local/netsaint/share/images/logos</i>).

An optional string that is used in the ALT tag of the image specified by the <i>&lt;icon_image&gt;</i> argument.  The ALT tag is used in both the <a href="cgis.html#status_cgi">status</a> and <a href="cgis.html#statusmap_cgi">statusmap</a> CGIs.
